# Why on Astar Network?

Astar is the best fit due to its cross-chain nature and ambition of being the central dapp hub on Polkadot. This allows Sirius Finance to have access to a great variety of stablecoins, not only on Astar, but also on polkadot, or even other chains, to increase liquidity, improve TVL and increase trading options. This great variety further encourages decentralization of our protocol since we can have a number of pools competing for a higher APY.

Secondly, Astar is building massive native defi protocols, like algorithm-based stablecoins, lending and yield aggregators. This is in sharp contrast with other parachains. These native protocols would work closely with Sirius Finance to enhance yield for liquidity providers.
