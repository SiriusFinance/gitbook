# What is stablecoin AMM?

In the Cryptocurrency ecosystem, most AMMs such as Uniswap, Pancakeswap, etc. use this protocol and allow almost all types of assets to be added to their liquidity pools and traded. A Stablecoin AMM which Sirius Finance is building focuses solely on stablecoins, that is to say, only stablecoins like USDC, USDT, etc. can be added to liquidity pools and also traded on this type of AMM.
