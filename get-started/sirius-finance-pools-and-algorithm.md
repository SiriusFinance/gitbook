# Sirius Finance pools and algorithm

**Sirius stable pool**

The Sirius Finance stable pool consists of 4 tokens — DAI, USDC, USDT and BUSD. The distribution of tokens within the pool is not always equal, as traders trade against the pool, it adds and removes tokens in the pool, changing the amount of pool tokens and their weights.&#x20;

To incentivize traders to balance the stable pool’s composition, Sirius Finance applies deposit bonus and withdrawal penalty as the pool tries to balance itself back into equal weights.



**Sirius meta pool**

Meta pools include pools which earn additional interest from decentralised lending protocols and pools list less liquid assets. Both enable LPers to earn extra rewards while preventing diluting existing pools.
