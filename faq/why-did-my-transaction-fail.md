# Why did my transaction fail?

A transaction may fail for different reasons, please check following:

* Your RPC endpoint is unreachable or too slow to respond.
* Slippage is too low for some imbalanced pools.
* Astar Network is becoming heavy, if your transaction has been pending for a long time, try to speed up by increasing gas price.
