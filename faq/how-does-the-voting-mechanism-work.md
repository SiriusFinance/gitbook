# How does the voting mechanism work?

On the vote page: [https://app.sirius.finance/#/vote](https://app.sirius.finance/#/vote)

Your votes affect the allocations of SRS between farms, you can vote for any farm but you can only vote for one specific farm ONCE in a 10-day voting period（starting from your voting time on that specific farm）, so please consider carefully before casting your votes.

Example A:

You vote on farm A on the 11th, whether you want to revoke (set it to 0 voting power) or change the proportion of your voting power, you will only be able to do it after the 21st.

\*Revoke is also considered as a voting behaviour which means you'll have to wait another 10 days to do the voting again. So if you don't want that farm have 0 of your voting power, please choose to change the proportion instead.



After you cast your votes on farms, your voting power will be added to that farm proportionally and automatically as you gain more veSRS.

Example B:

If you cast 50% of your initial voting power to farm A, another 50% of your initial voting power to farm B; your later increased voting power will be distributed to farm A and farm B 50% / 50% automatically;

Example C:

If you cast 30% of your initial voting power to farm A, another 30% of initial voting power to farm B, at this moment, you still have 40% of your initial power left; With your later increased voting power, 30% will be distributed to farm A automatically, another 30% will be distributed to farm B automatically.  You can still vote on other farms(C, D, etc) with 40% of your later increased voting power plus 40% of your initial voting power.
