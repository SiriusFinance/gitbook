# Why is veSRS worth earning

veSRS holders can gain a boost factor up to 3x and earn extra trading fees(when the admin fee is changed by governance in the future).

More importantly, veSRS holders can vote on various DAO proposals, and pool parameters which include but are not limited to:

> Admin fee percentage;

> Pool weight;

> Amplification coefficient;

> Add or remove metapools and tokens;

> Preferred right for bonus rewards;

> …

As more pools are added and more assets are bridged to Astar Network, voting rights will become increasingly valuable to decide how future rewards will be distributed.
